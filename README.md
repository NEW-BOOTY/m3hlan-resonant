## Overview
The **M3hl@n! Resonant Convergence Algorithm** is a branded, error‑handling build orchestration ecosystem.  
It uses a **Makefile** as the central orchestrator and **Bash scripts** as execution agents. Each stage embodies originality, robust error handling, and brand DNA.

---

## Features
- **Error Handling & Self‑Healing**: Detect anomalies, retry, and log branded repair narratives.
- **Makefile Orchestration**: Targets for `sense`, `align`, `act`, `record`, `resonate`, `originality`, `temporal`, and `docs`.
- **Originality Enforcement**: Scripts ban clichés and inject unique brand signatures.
- **Brand Integration**: Custom lexicon, celebratory rituals (“GOT UM.”), and signature banners.
- **Temporal Layering**: Snapshot and rollback capabilities for branching futures.
- **Flagship Project Seeding**: Nodes for Unified Build System, Error Ritual Engine, Lexicon Linter, and more.
- **Auditability**: Logs with timestamps, provenance hashes, and branded reports.

## Usage
1. Make scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x *.sh
Run the full convergence cycle:
bash
make resonance-cycle
Roll back to the last snapshot:
bash
make rollback
Generate documentation:
bash
make docs
Expansion Strategy
Add one new check or feature per script per cycle.
Keep logs branded and consistent.
Use snapshots to experiment safely.
Treat each expansion as a flagship node in the resonance graph.
