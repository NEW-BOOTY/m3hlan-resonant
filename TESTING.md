## Running Tests
- Execute `make resonance-cycle` to validate the full pipeline.
- Check logs in `logs/` for anomalies and rituals.
- Verify snapshots in `temporal_layers/`.

---

## Stage-Specific Tests
- **Sense**: Simulate missing dependencies or high CPU load.
- **Align**: Test misaligned weights and conflict detection.
- **Act**: Inject cliché content and confirm originality enforcement.
- **Record**: Validate provenance hashes and report generation.
- **Resonate**: Force low scores and confirm adaptive boosts.
- **Originality**: Test artifacts against corpus for uniqueness.
- **Temporal**: Snapshot and rollback multiple cycles.

## Success Criteria
- Anomalies detected and logged.
- Rituals triggered (“GOT UM.”).
- Artifacts signed and defensible.
- Reports generated with provenance.
