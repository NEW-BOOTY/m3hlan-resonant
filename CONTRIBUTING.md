## Philosophy
The **M3hl@n! Resonant Convergence Algorithm** is not just code — it is a branded ecosystem.  
Every contribution must preserve:
- **Originality**: no clichés, boilerplate, or derivative work.
- **Error Rituals**: anomalies must trigger branded recovery steps (e.g., “GOT UM.”).
- **Auditability**: logs must include timestamps, provenance hashes, and branded lexicon.
- **Brand DNA**: signature banners, stylized logs, and unique identifiers embedded in artifacts.

---

## Contribution Workflow
1. **Fork and branch**: Create a feature branch for your changes.
2. **Stage expansion**: Add one new check or feature per script per cycle.
3. **Consistency**: Ensure logs, rituals, and lexicon are consistent across all scripts.
4. **Testing**: Run `make resonance-cycle` to validate the full pipeline.
5. **Documentation**: Update README and docs target outputs with your changes.
6. **Pull request**: Submit with a clear description of the anomaly addressed, the ritual added, and the originality enforced.

## Stage Expansion Guidelines

### Sense (signal collection)
- Add system health checks (CPU, memory, disk).
- Verify dependencies and log missing tools.
- Probe external APIs with retries.
- Emit branded markers on anomalies.

### Align (objective balancing)
- Implement dynamic weighting based on priorities.
- Use historical logs to adjust current alignment.
- Detect conflicts between originality and reliability.
- Output alignment vectors for resonance graphing.

### Act (interventions)
- Rewrite artifacts to enforce originality.
- Add self-healing retries with alternative strategies.
- Inject banners, watermarks, and unique identifiers.
- Branch interventions based on anomaly type.

### Record (provenance)
- Log in JSON, Markdown, and text formats.
- Sign logs with SHA-256 or GPG.
- Capture decision rationale and retries.
- Auto-generate branded reports.

### Resonate (harmony scoring)
- Compute scores factoring originality, reliability, brand coherence, and performance.
- Analyze resonance across project nodes.
- Trigger alerts for low resonance.
- Apply adaptive boosts to restore harmony.

### Originality (governor)
- Detect clichés with semantic analysis.
- Compare artifacts against corpus of past projects.
- Measure signature density.
- Rewrite artifacts to exceed originality thresholds.

### Temporal (layering)
- Support branching futures and parallel strategies.
- Enable per-stage rollbacks.
- Tag snapshots with semantic versions.
- Output timeline data for visualization.

## Flagship Projects
Contributors may expand or seed the following flagship nodes:
- Unified Build System
- Error Ritual Engine
- Lexicon Linter
- Signature Banner Injector
- Temporal Layer Store
- Resonance Graph Visualizer
- Originality Governor
- Smart Glasses Integration
- Healthcare Logistics Optimizer
- Brand-Integrated CLI

---

## Code Style
- Use **tabs** in Makefiles (not spaces).
- Include copyright banners in every script.
- Use branded lexicon consistently (“compile anomaly,” “ritual,” “signature”).
- Keep logs in `logs/` and snapshots in `temporal_layers/`.

---

## Review Process
- Every PR is reviewed for originality, ritual consistency, and brand DNA.
- Contributions that dilute originality or omit rituals will be rejected.
- Approved changes are merged into the resonance graph and documented.
