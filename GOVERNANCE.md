## Decision-Making
- **Central Orchestrator**: The Makefile defines the convergence cycle.
- **Stage Owners**: Each Bash script has a designated maintainer.
- **Flagship Nodes**: Expansion projects are seeded as resonance graph nodes.

---

## Review Process
- Pull requests reviewed for originality, ritual consistency, and brand DNA.
- Logs and provenance must be included in every submission.
- Approved changes merged into the resonance graph.

---

## Roadmap
- Phase 1: Core cycle stabilization.
- Phase 2: Advanced stage expansions (semantic originality, branching futures).
- Phase 3: Resonance graph visualization and flagship integrations.
